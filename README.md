Creating the slideshow and form validation was a bit tricky. For the slideshow, displaying images was easy, but making them change smoothly with JavaScript was confusing at first. I used a variable called 'slideIndex' to help switch between images, and functions like 'showSlides' and 'plusSlides' made it easy to move through the gallery.

For the form validation, ensuring users entered information correctly and displaying error messages for mistakes was challenging. The main lesson from these challenges was to break down complex problems into smaller steps, write JavaScript in an organized way, and make the website as user-friendly as possible.
